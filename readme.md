## Project status: IDLE

This project is currently idle and is not maintained. It presents policing-related data without context, which may result in viewers misunderstanding or mischaracterizing data in ways that potentially impact historically marginalized and oppressed groups, particularly communities of color. If you're interested in revising this project, please contact OpenOakland's Steering Committee at [steering@openoakland.org](mailto:steering@openoakland.org). Let us know why you're interested and what you hope to accomplish. Consider using the [Project Exploration Worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k24P9JiAUEzJLPFRDjVh7aRZexax6NUhfPFLSI3R80M/edit?usp=sharing) to realign this project with OpenOakland's mission and values (required for all new OpenOakland projects).
